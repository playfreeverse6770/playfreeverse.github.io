        Independent Game Development & Editor Tools
      </div>

      <p>
        PlayFreeverse is an independent development project focused on building
        original games and practical editor tools through hands-on production experience.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- STORY -->
    <section class="section">
      <h2>Our Story</h2>

      <p>
        PlayFreeverse started as a game development initiative.
        While working on an open-world game prototype, we encountered repeated
        limitations in scene inspection, debugging, and iteration workflows.
      </p>

      <p>
        Instead of relying solely on existing tools, we began creating internal
        editor extensions to better understand, analyze, and safely modify complex scenes.
        Over time, these internal tools became stable, reusable, and valuable beyond
        a single project.
      </p>

      <p>
        This process led to the creation of <strong>BOSA</strong> —
        a growing set of editor tools designed from real production needs.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- CURRENT TOOL -->
    <section class="section">
      <h2>Current Focus: BOSA – Base</h2>

      <div class="card">
        <p>
          <strong>BOSA – Base</strong> is the first public release of our internal tooling.
          It provides essential editor-side utilities for scene analysis,
          structured JSON inspection, object placement, and safe scene backups.
        </p>

        <p>
          This version is intentionally lightweight and focused.
          It is designed for developers who want visibility and control
          without introducing risk to their projects.
        </p>

        <p>
          BOSA – Base is an editor-only toolset and does not include runtime components.
        </p>
      </div>

    <!-- PROJECTS -->
    <section class="section">
      <h2>Game Projects</h2>

      <div class="card">
        <h3>Freeverse (In Development)</h3>
        <p>
          Freeverse is an open-world game concept focused on exploration,
          systemic gameplay, and large-scale scene composition.
          The complexity of this project directly influenced the design
          of our internal editor tools.
        </p>

        <h3>Experimental Concepts</h3>
        <p>
          Alongside Freeverse, we experiment with smaller gameplay ideas and prototypes,
          such as fast-paced sports mechanics and stylized strategy concepts.
          These experiments help validate tools across different genres and scales.
        </p>
      </div>
    </section>

    <!-- PHILOSOPHY -->
    <section class="section">
      <h2>Tooling Philosophy</h2>

      <p>
        Our tools are built with the same mindset as our games:
        clarity over complexity, safety over shortcuts, and extensibility over rigid design.
      </p>

      <p>
        Every public tool we release originates from real usage inside a working project.
        We avoid speculative features and focus on workflows that have already proven useful.
